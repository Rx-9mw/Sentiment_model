[pozytywna],If you are a Link Wray Fan! I just bought this CD and it's really great! John is still as good as ever and plays his guitar as the hot artist he is. If you get into real rock stuff then dont miss this one! I saw John play with Mick Fleetwood and Anton Fig together on stage and it was really cool. Good luck John on this CD and we hope you will do another one soon!
[negatywna],Disappointing. I thought that this would be gummy. I had some sticky putty like substance that was this size and came in a roll. I used it for flower arrangements and helping candles stand up in their holders. This was basically white paper. It held nothing and was useless. The postage to send it back was more than the cost. So it's just sitting in a drawer waiting to find a use for it.
[pozytywna],This is a great book for beginners! I loved the recipes and nutritional information. There is even a list of manufacturers in the back of the book.
[pozytywna],"The Nader Reader. Ralph Nader brought up many important issues in this year's presidential race. Many of these are seen throughout the writings in this book and it is apparent that the problems he talks about are not recent, nor are they going to go away without any massive efforts.Nader's style is a little dry and difficult to read at times, but the points he brings up (especially in the sections on the presidency, democracy, and grassroots organizing) are vital to the progressive movement. His sections on tort reform and law practice are a little more technical and are probably best understood by those in the field.Nader has stood by his convictions from the time he started fighting GM to today. This is an excellent book that traces his numerous crusades throughout the decades and gives a boost to the future."
[negatywna],"Written for the Intellectual Elite and Not the Average Reader. Ralph Nader has been around for some time and has had his day.He claims to be a populist, caliming to be for the people. However, when you read his books, you can see that he is really writing for the sake of the intellectual elite. He does not write to acoomodate average readers thus failing to get his point through to them. Well, so much for being a populist and a man of the people.Nader just does a lot of talking and writing and accomplishes nothing.In the presidential election, all he succeeded in doing was drawing votes away from Al Gore allowing George W. Bush to win the election giving us eight more years of Reagan-Bush policies which have ultimately led us to this financil disaster on Wall Street and all over the United States."
[negatywna],"Loquacious and another world. For a person living and working in the British Isles, 'Teach Yourself Copywriting' by J. Jonathan Gabay may be a fine read. But I don't live there. Residency aside, I found this book to be overly wordy to the point of feeling like I was slogging through swamps of verbiage to find a useful morsel. And there are useful bits there, it's just that it boarders on not being worth the time and effort to get to them. Someone interested in the topic of copywriting would do better to read similar books by Robert Bly or Peter Bowerman, both much more interesting and succinct; my apologies to Brits everywhere."
[negatywna],"Better than you realize. Like most, I was expecting(hoping) for something that hit me between the eyes as a classic(When doves Cry, Sign O' the times). And in that respect, I was disappointed. But being a fan, I forced myself to listen again without the expectations, as most non-fans will hear the song. And what I heard was a beautiful melody, a chorus that implants itself in your head, subtle guitar underscoring the singing, and harmonies that send chills. Yeah, it's commercial, but it's far, far better than most of the bland stuff I'm hearing on the radio. And nobody out there could sing a song like this the way he can."
[pozytywna],"This is my first PDA/Organizer. I purchased this about 4 months ago and it really is easy to use especially if you are familiar with Microsoft Word and Excel. I use it to copy files from my PC that I want to have handy. The only thing I wish it had is a backlight. But that hasn't come into play too often. I usually have to charge it every 2 or 3 days. I recommend this product if you are not worried about having a lot accessories to go with it, because they are not that many available."
[negatywna],"Piece of Crap. I have ordered thousands of items in my lifetime, and bar none, this is the biggest piece of crap I have ever received. It is supposed to come completely put together, but when it arrived, there were no less than 10 little parts that had come off the screen assembly and one screen that was loose and all of its parts dangling. The first thing that happenned is that I cut myself on one of the screens because the protective side had come off. I was bleeding for quite some time. The second thing I noticed was the extremely poor quality of the material and assembly. I am very handy by nature, but even I had to give up trying to put this piece of junk back together again. Plus it was not worth it, even if I had put it together again, all I would have then had was a piece of crap fireplace screen."
[negatywna],"Okay at first, but died pretty quickly... My parents ordered me these new speakers when they got me a new monitor. For awhile, they did work fine, and the sound quality was great. However, the other day, they randomly died on me after about 3 months' use. I'm stuck trying to find another relatively inexpensive set of speakers (while still giving the audio quality I'm looking for)."
[pozytywna],"Great Little Speakers for Music. I like to listen to internet radio and CDs while I work. Not listening too loudly, though I have been known to turn it up for the occasional song now and then. For my use and for the price, these are great speakers: not tinny, decent bass."
[pozytywna],"Great Bench Kit! I made a small (24\\"" long) warming bench for sitting next to our new Tilikivi fireplace using cherry 2 x 4's finished with rubbing lacquer. The 2 x 4 Basic bench ends are very sturdy and attractive. The green color is nice"," but I sprayed them flat black with all purpose paint to match our other fireplace accessories. High quality product."""

[negatywna],"Huh? The CD's over? Best nap I ever took. Ferry, Ferry, Ferry. WHAT ARE YOU DOING!? I can't believe that you mixed half of this crap. Frist off besides being boring, this complation is the same trance cd with the same songs that everyone else is putting out. With the likes of a genious such as Ferry Corsten, I expected something more. There are only a handful of songs that redeemed this cd. I'm not saying that the songs on it are bad, but rather old and played out. If I have to hear Bt's Dreaming on one more CD this year, I'm gonna shoot myself! If you truly like your trance to make you get up and dance, check Ferry's earlier work on the MOS series or check out any of the Euphoria cd's or Dj Tiesto. If you have a hard time going to sleep, this is the cd for you.",
[pozytywna],"The Celtic Knotwork Handbook, a perfect book for beginers. If you are just getting started, or have been interested in knotwork for a while, this is a great book! It provides historical information, diagrams, how to make circular knots, anamorphics, and more than 100 original knots, which include corners, borders, and motifs. This is the best keltic knot book I've seen.",
[pozytywna],"We love Mr. Putter and Tabby! My children, ages three and five, adore Mr. Puuter and Tabby, and I believe this is Ms. Rylant's funniest rendition of their adventures so far. When the box arrived, I read the book alone because I couldn't stand to wait. Ms. Rylant uses a nice collection of short and medium-length words for beginning readers, and the story rollicks along. Mr. Howard's illustrations capture the subjects' expressions beautifully. We checked these books out of the library so often that we finally ordered some to keep.",
[negatywna],Not unless you're a time traveler. ... This book is OLD and nigh unto useless unless you frequently travel in time to the first month after MacOS X Server was released. There's a reason why brick-and-mortar stores remove books from shelves and place them on the [bargain] rack. ...,
[negatywna],"not useful anymore. While this book seemed very appealing for someone who is new to Mac OS X server and its Linux underpinnings, it is almost worthless at this point in time since it has not been updated to include the major changes that have been made in the past couple years. Save your money and visit online resources; they are much more valuable.",
[negatywna],MAC OS X SERVER Administrator's Guide. I was looking for a book that would be a guide to OSX Server since the information included with the software was thin at best. What I found was a text that took the little information that I found in the documentation and puffed it up to over 300 pages with not much more to offer. In all fairness I did pick up some information but it was not worth the price. I'll keep the book on the shelf but it will not be looked at often.,
[negatywna],"Bulb: 10,000 hours; transformer: 250 hours. The bulb is rated for up to 10,000 hours, but the transformer only lasted about 250 hours. The transformer is part of the cord and is not replaceable. Ott-Lite won't respond to my e-mail inquiries and doesn't list transformers as a replacement part. I tried a variety of sources for an 18w. transformer that could be modified to accommodate the lamp, but the cheapest I could find was about $30.00. I bought a brand new Hampton Bay table lamp (similar to the Ott-Lite lamp) at Home Depot for $20.00. If your Ott-Lite ceases to work you'll probably assume that the bulb must be replaced and spend $15.00 or so for a new bulb, only to discover that it's not a bulb problem. So you end up with a lamp that won't work and two bulbs you can't use on any other fixture. Don't buy Ott-Lite products...and exchange any Ott-Lite gifts you might receive.",
[negatywna],"Don't Buy Ott. Buyers, be warned! I bought an Ott Lite a year ago, and was using it for needlework. Then one day, it did not work. I bought a new bulb for it, and it still didn't work. Then I learned about the ballast problems, and join the long line of people that bought from Ott and have expensive lights that no longer work. A beautiful lamp is now done for. I'll never buy another Ott product again. Steer clear!",

[pozytywna],"Extremely Useful for Me and Others. As a teacher and collegiate athletic coach I found \\""Taming Your Gremlin\""\"" and \""\""A Master Class in Gremlin Taming\""\"" to be extremely beneficial.

[pozytywna],I like this keyboard a lot! My keyboard at work is so easy to use that I had to find something better for home. This one is actually really good for the price. It's not as flat as the one I have at work (sony vaio) but it is still really easy to use compared to most and it doesn't take up much room on my desk which is nice. I type extremely fast so I was looking for something that would keep up. This one does. The keys are fairly flat and light. I'm glad I bought it.,,

[negatywna],"Very Disappointed. I expected more about how to create luck, maybe why people feel lucky and how they obtain it, not read pages and pages about luck in the casinos. Nothing really helped me in this book. Explaining others' Gambling and lucky streaks did nothing to help me and in fact bored me. Absolutely no meat to this book. Since I don't gamble, I thought I would scream when more and more pages about gambling began. This book was not what I expected at all. Very disappointed.",,

[negatywna],"CRAP. this is not music, no matter what anyone says. Its crap! anyone can make these tracks. to write an album like this you need the following: 1. no talent, what so ever. 2. loop a bunch of randomized drum beats, then put distortion on em. 3. have some idiot screaming with heavy distortion and a vocoder in the backround about death. 4. have some low end wet synth bass playing somthing that makes no sence 5. every 20 seconds have some annoying ass distorted ear bleeding noise come in and then cut off real short. 6. dont forget to tie yourslef in to the industrial scene. if you want real talent!? and still want that industrial noise? look up a band called \\""the lack\""\"" they kill!""",,

However, there is a very hard to read warning on the underside of the train that says that hair may become tangled in wheels. They are not kidding!

Fun toy, but can be dangerous.",,

[pozytywna],"Almost Great, Until it Broke... My son recieved this as a birthday gift 2 months ago. He LOVED it even though it didn't corner well on our Mellissa and Doug train track. He mostly let it run on the floor, not the track, so that wasn't that big of an issue. It did, however, break after one fall from counter height. My son let it drive off the kitchen counter and after only 2 short months it is officially broken. It can still be played with but because it is meant to be motor driven it doesn't work that well as a push-powered train. Overall I'm disappointed, a toy that only last 2 months just isn't worth it.",,,

You need one battery to operate the train and it seems to work well - it can pull other cars quite weel and climb up and down the tracks.

[negatywna],"Comedy Scene, and Not Heard. This DVD will be a disappointment if you get it hoping to see some substantial portion of the acts of the various comics listed on the cover. All you get here are snippets of performance, at best. The rest is just loose-leaf reminiscence about the good old days in Boston, in the early 80's, when a lot of comics were hanging out together and getting their start.It's like a frat house reunion. There's a lot of lame nostalgia. There are quite a few guffaws recalling jokes (practical and otherwise)perpetrated - back then. But you had to have been there to appreciate all the basically good ol' boy camaraderie. If you weren't actually a part of that scene, all this joshing and jostling will fall flat.If you want to actually hear some of these comics' routines - you will have to look elsewhere."
