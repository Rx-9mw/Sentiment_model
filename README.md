# How To Run
1. Install anaconda from the offical website
2. Open the Anaconda Prompt
3. Create a new anaconda environment:

conda create -n *NAME FOR THE ENV* python=3.9
```
4. Activate the environment:
```sh
conda activate *NAME OF THE ENV*
```
5. Install the packages for the script:
```sh
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
6. Create a new folder and open it with a code editor
7. Initialize git and copy the repo into it (I'm not including the test and train csv's because of their size)
8. Put the test.csv and train.csv files into the Data folder
9. Navigate to the folder in the Anaconda Prompt, then into the Training_script folder
10. Run sentiment_model_trainer.py within the Anaconda Prompt:
