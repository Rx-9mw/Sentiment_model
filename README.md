## Overview

This project implements a deep learning-based sentiment analysis system for product reviews using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network enhanced with a custom Attention mechanism.

The system was developed as part of an Engineering Thesis and focuses on binary sentiment classification (Positive / Negative) of product reviews from the Amazon Reviews Dataset.

The project includes:

* Data preprocessing pipeline
* Custom Attention Layer implementation
* BiLSTM sentiment classification model
* Training and evaluation tools
* Desktop GUI built with Tkinter
* Model persistence and loading

## Key Features

✅ Bidirectional LSTM architecture

✅ Custom Attention Mechanism

✅ Large-scale dataset support (Amazon Reviews)

✅ Automatic dataset balancing

✅ Early Stopping and Learning Rate Scheduling

✅ L2 Regularization and Dropout

✅ Graphical User Interface

✅ Reproducible training process (Seed = 42)
